//   x/y : matches when the field equals x+n*y where n is an integer
//   x-z: matches when the field is between x and z inclusive
//   w,x,y,...: matches when the field is one of the listed values
// Each x, y, z, ... is either a decimal integer, or a month or day of week name
// or abbreviation (in the appropriate fields).
// A second in time matches if all fields match.
// day_of_week uses 0 or 7 as Sunday
